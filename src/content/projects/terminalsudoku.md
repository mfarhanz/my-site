## About

**Terminal Sudoku** is a simple, command-line Sudoku game built in Python. It runs entirely in the terminal with a custom ASCII-styled interface inspired by figlet-style text. The app supports a set of commands that make playing, exploring, and solving puzzles straightforward and interactive.

## Commands

- `help` — Shows the basic rules of Sudoku.  
- `info` — Displays general information about the program.  
- `commands` — Lists available commands the user can enter.  
- `solve` — Activates the auto-solver, which can be stopped at any time.  
- `hint` — Shows a random hint to help with the current puzzle.  
- `reset` — Generates a brand-new Sudoku grid.  
- `clear` — Clears the terminal screen.  
- `exit` — Quits the program.

### Notes

This isn’t a large or complex project, just a fun little tool I made after playing board games with my siblings. I like building ASCII and terminal-based programs whenever I get the chance, and this was a great excuse to make another one.
