**SnakeSim** is a Python application built with Tkinter that visualizes classic pathfinding algorithms through the mechanics of the Snake game. Instead of moving a simple point across a grid, the algorithms operate inside a full Snake environment, complete with obstacles, movement rules, and dynamic states.

## Features

- **Pathfinding Simulation**  
  Run algorithms like A*, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and others inside a Snake-style grid.

- **Maze Generation**  
  Generate mazes using different algorithms, with walls acting as obstacles the snake cannot pass through.

- **Step-by-Step Visualization**  
  Watch every stage of the process, from maze construction to each move made by the snake during pathfinding.

- **Simulation Controls**  
  Step through the simulation one frame at a time, pause it, or let it run automatically.

- **Editable Grid**  
  Draw or erase walls, reposition elements, and customize the layout however you like.

- **Gameplay Modes**  
  Play traditional Snake (you chase the food) or switch to the inverted mode where *you* are the target and the snake hunts you.

- **Quality-of-Life Tools**  
  Extra controls to tweak behavior, maze patterns, and simulation speed.

## Purpose

SnakeSim was built as an intuitive learning tool to better understand fundamental pathfinding algorithms. By embedding them into a Snake environment, their differences become clearer, more dynamic, and more interesting to observe.
