# About

CoolCounter is a simple and lightweight web application that lets you increment, decrement, and reset a counter. While it doesn't serve a complex real-world purpose, it was built as a fast, hands-on project to get familiar with **React** and **TailwindCSS**.

The main goal was to explore the framework and styling workflow while building something minimal, interactive, and visually customizable.

## Features

- Increment, decrement, and reset the counter
- Customize the counter’s foreground color, background color, and font
- Fast and responsive UI built with TailwindCSS
- Designed as a simple playground to practice React patterns and component structure

## Notes

- Starter project for experimenting with frontend frameworks
- Demonstrates clean state management and simple UI interactivity
