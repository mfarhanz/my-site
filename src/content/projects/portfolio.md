# About

Hey, you’re on my personal portfolio! This is where I share my projects, experiments, and maybe a few writeups (maybe).

I didn’t get around to making it as early as I wanted, but it was a fun process and taught me a lot about UI, frontend structure, and finding a workflow that actually clicks.

I’m keeping this as my main hub alongside GitHub, with new work and interactive bits appearing here over time.

## Stack

- **SvelteKit** + **TypeScript** for routing and rendering  
- **TailwindCSS** for layouts and styling  
- **mdsvex** to handle markdown-based project pages and writeups  

## Reflections

Building this site gave me a lot of hands-on experience with UI, layout, and putting together a frontend from scratch. It’s been a great way to figure out what workflows and patterns click for me, and to experiment with structuring a project in a way that actually makes sense while coding.  

I’m also looking forward to exploring tools like D3.js, Three.js, React Three Fiber, and shaders to add more interactivity and visual depth. For now, the site does what I need, and it’s a solid base to keep iterating on as I try out new ideas and features.
