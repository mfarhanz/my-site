## About

**TextRender** is a small Python CLI script that converts images or GIFs into ASCII art displayed in the terminal. It uses a duotone palette, assigning one symbol for the foreground and one for the background.

This project was purely experimental, created to explore image thresholding, numpy masking, and basic terminal rendering. Beyond displaying images in ASCII, it serves no additional purpose.
